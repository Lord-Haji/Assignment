To run the app, you need to have Python installed on your system. Once Python is installed, you can set up and run the application by following these steps:

1. **Install Required Packages**:
   Open your command line interface (CLI) and navigate to the project directory. Then install the necessary Python packages using the command:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   In the same CLI window, start the application by running the command:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
